# Uplift-Modelling
We try to develop a library that provide many methods to asses uplift models.
All methods that we used in this library take from:

	Radcliffe NJ. 2012. Moment of Uplift. Technical Note. August 7 2012 Version 2.
	Radcliffe NJ. Using Control Groups to Target on Predicted Lift: Building and Assessing Uplift Models.
	Naranjo OM. 2012. Testing a New Metric for Uplift Models. The University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics.
  	Athey S, Imbens GW. 2015. Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effects.

and the data take from Kevin-Hilstrom blogspot.

We also need to say thanks to Kyriakos Stylianopoulos who have build multiscorer library for cross_val_score from Scikit-Learn.

Hopefully, the library that we have built can be useful for all readers. Thanks!
